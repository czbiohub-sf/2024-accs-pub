# Automated Cell Culture Splitter
This repository accompanies the 2024 article ["Open-source cell culture automation system with integrated cell counting for passaging microplate cultures"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.27.629034). It contains the code and original data used to produce the quantitative figures for the article, as referenced in the data availability statement, and also serves as a hub for links to other resources for reproducing the Automated Cell Culture Splitter.

## What is this?
The Automated Cell Culture Splitter (ACCS) is a system that does automated splitting of cells in 96-well plates using an Opentrons OT-2 pipetting robot and a custom cell counting instrument. The design and software are open-source. Check out the preprint for more context.
